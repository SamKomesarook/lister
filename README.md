This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing

Run `npm run test:e2e` for testing.

## Further improvements

I'd add some unit tests, although there weren't too many functions that would have benifited from that...
I'd install and configure prettier cause not having the auto-formatter i'm used to sucks.
I'd figure out a cleaner way of displaying the expanding lists.
